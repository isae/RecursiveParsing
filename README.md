# RecursiveParsing
Recursive descent parser for arithmetic expressions, with visualisation of parsing tree and testing

Tasks:

1. Design a naive context-free grammar for arithmetic expressions
(with plus, binary and unary minuses, multiply and parentheses), to eliminate left recursion and right branching

2. Develop a lexical analyzer(lexer), skipping spaces

3. Build FIRST and FOLLOW sets for non-terminating symbols. Develop a parser.

4. Develop a visualization system for visualization of parsing tree

5. Cover code with tests
